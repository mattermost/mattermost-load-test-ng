# Mattermost load-test-ng

Mattermost load-test-ng provides a set of tools written in [Go](https://golang.org/) to help profiling [Mattermost](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost) under heavy load, simulating real-world usage of a server installation at scale.

It's a complete rewrite of the [previous](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-load-test) load-test tool which served as inspiration.

## Goals

- Give an estimate on the maximum number of concurrently active users the target system supports.
- Enable more control over the load to generate through the use of [Controllers](docs/controllers.md).
- Provide extensive documentation from lower level code details to higher level guides and walk-throughs.

## How to use

There are mainly two ways to run a load-test:

- On a Terraform deployment. This is the recommended way to start a load-test for production. [Link to the guide](docs/terraform_loadtest.md)
- Locally. This is a good way to getting started and better understand the inner mechanics. [Link to the guide](docs/local_loadtest.md)

See the [user workflow guide](docs/load-test-how-to-use.md) for details.
