# Mattermost Load Test NG Browser Library

This library provides shared types, utilities, and helper functions for browser-based load testing of Mattermost using Playwright.

## Installation

To build and install the library, run:

```bash
make build
```

This command compiles the code, generates type declarations, and packages the library. The resulting package will be located in the `browser/packs` directory.

## Development

After making changes to the library, run the build command again to update the package in the `browser/packs` directory.
To publish a new version of the library, please contact the Mattermost team to have the package published to the npm registry.
