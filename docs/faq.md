## FAQ

### What is a bounded load-test?

We define a load-test to be bounded when the number of simulated users is fixed.
This is particularly useful when running performance comparisons between two clusters/builds.

#### Note

To manually run a bounded load-test using the [`coordinator`](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-load-test-ng/blob/master/docs/coordinator.md) the [feedback loop](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-load-test-ng/blob/master/docs/coordinator.md#the-feedback-loop) should be disabled. This can be done by either removing `MonitorConfig.Queries` or by disabling each query (by setting `Alert` to `false`).

### What is an unbounded load-test?

We define a load-test to be unbounded when the number of simulated users can vary up to a pre-configured limit.
This type of load-test is used to determine the capacity of a system and will output an estimated number of users.
The rule of thumb is that when starting an unbounded load-test we should always shoot for more users than what we think an installation can support.
`ClusterConfig.MaxActiveUsers`  should be set to  `AgentInstanceCount * UsersConfiguration.MaxActiveUsers`.

## Troubleshooting

### Users are not connecting

Make sure that both `Enable Account Creation` and `Enable Open Server` settings are set to `true` in MM System Console.

### Agent logs show several `current team should be set` errors.

This can be caused by the app server not being initialized (at least one open team should be created). This can be done manually or through the `ltctl loadtest init` command.
Also the `Max Users Per Team` setting in Mattermost System Console should be enough to account for the number of simulated users.
