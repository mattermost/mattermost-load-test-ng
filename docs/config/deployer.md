## AWSAMI

*string*

AWS AMI to use for the deployment. This is the image used for all EC2 instances created by the loadtest tool. See the [AWS AMI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html) docs for more information. We suggest Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04. Note, the AMI could change between AWS Regions.



## ClusterName

*string*

The name of the cluster. This will be prefixed to all resources in AWS that are built with the configuration.

## ClusterVpcID

The ID of the VPC associated to the resources.

**Note**

This setting only affects load-test agent instances. It is meant for pre-deployed environments.

## ClusterSubnetID

*string*

The ID of the subnet associated to the resources.

**Note**

This setting only affects load-test agent instances. It is meant for pre-deployed environments.

## AppInstanceCount

*int*

The number of Mattermost application instances.
This value can be set to zero to enable a load-test agents only deployment.
When this value is greater than one, an S3 bucket is automatically created in the deployment and the server is configured to use it as a file store.

## AppInstanceType

*string*

The type of the EC2 instance of the application server. See type [here](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/). It is recommended to use c5 instances for consistent performance.

## AgentInstanceCount

*int*

The number of load-test agent instances. The first instance will also host the [coordinator](coordinator.md).

## AgentInstanceType

*string*

The type of the EC2 instance of the loadtest agent. See type [here](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/).

## ElasticSearchSettings

### InstanceCount

*int*

Number of ElasticSearch instances to be created. Right now, this config only supports the values `1` or `0`.

### InstanceType

*string*

The type of instance for the Elasticsearch service. Only AWS OpenSearch instances are allowed. Instances that do not support EBS storage volumes are not allowed. Check [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/supported-instance-types.html) for the full list of instance types.

### Version

*string*

Version of Elasticsearch to be deployed. Deployments only support AWS OpenSearch versions compatible with ElasticSearch, up to and including ElasticSearch v7.10.0; i.e., the ones prefixed by `Elasticsearch_.`. Check [AWS documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/faqs/) to learn more about the versions and the [`aws` Terraform provider documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/opensearch_domain#engine_version) to learn more about the specific string used.

## VpcID

*string*

Id for the VPC that is going to be associated with the Elasticsearch created instance. You can get the VPC Id [here](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/).

This ID is mandatory is you're going to instantiate an ES service in your cluster.

### CreateRole

*bool*

Elasticsearch depends on the `AWSServiceRoleForAmazonElasticsearchService` service-linked role. This role is unique and shared by all users of the account so if it's already created you can't create it again and you'll receive an error.

You can check if the role is already created [here](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#roles) and if it isn't created set this property to true.

### SnapshotRepository

*string*

If you want to make a deployment containing an Elasticsearch server, and you have a database that has been previously indexed, you need to provide both the name of such a repository where the snapshot lives and the snapshot's name. `SnapshotRepository` is the name of the repository.

A *snapshot repository*, as [defined by Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/snapshot-restore.html#snapshot-workflow), is a storage location that contains snapshots of an Elasticsearch cluster. Elasticsearch supports different repository types, but the only one supported for now in the load-test tool are S3 buckets.

### SnapshotName

*string*

If you want to deploy an already indexed database, you need to provide both the name of the repository where the snapshot lives and the snapshot's name. `SnapshotName` is the name of the snapshot itself.

### RestoreTimeoutMinutes

*int*

The maximum time, in minutes, that the system will wait for the Elasticsearch snapshot to be restored. Defaults to 45 minutes.

### ClusterTimeoutMinutes

*int*

The maximum time, in minutes, that the system will wait for the Elasticsearch cluster status to get green after having restored the snapshot. Defaults to 45 minutes.

## JobServerSettings

### InstanceCount

*int*

Number of instances to be created. Supported values are `1` or `0`. Once a job server is deployed, all of the periodic jobs will run on this instance.

### InstanceType

*string*

The type of EC2 instance for the Job Server. See type [here](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/).

## EnableAgentFullLogs

*bool*

Allows to log the agent service command output (`stdout` & `stderr`) to home directory.

## ProxyInstanceType

*string*

The type of the EC2 instance of the proxy server. See type [here](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/).

### DBName

*string*

The name of the database. This is meant to be used in conjunction with `ClusterIdentifier`, and its value should be the name of the database in such cluster.

However, it can be used by itself to hardcode the name of the database that will otherwise be created. If `DBName` is not specified, and a brand new database is created for the deployment, its name will equal `${ClusterName}db`.

### DBParameters

*[]DBParameter*

A list of DB specific parameters to use for the created instance.
Detailed information on these values can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_WorkingWithParamGroups.html).

## TerraformStateDir

*string*

The directory under which Terraform-related files are stored. If the directory does not exist, it will be created when running the first command that needs it, defaulting to `/var/lib/mattermost-load-test-ng`. You'll need root permissions to create that specific directory, so you may want to change this setting to something like `/home/youruser/.loadtest`.

## S3BucketDumpURI

*string*

URI pointing to an S3 bucket: something of the form `s3://bucket-name/optional-subdir`.
The contents of this bucket will be copied to the bucket created in the deployment, using `aws s3 cp`. This command is ran locally, so having the AWS CLI installed is required.
If no bucket is created in the deployment (see [`AppInstanceCount`](#AppInstanceCount) for more information), this value is ignored.
If a bucket is created in the deployment but this value is empty, the created bucket will not be pre-populated with any data.

## DBDumpURI

*string*

An optional URI to a MM server database dump file
to be loaded before running the load-test.
The file is expected to be gzip compressed.
This can also point to a local file if prefixed with "file://".
In such case, the dump file will be uploaded to the app servers.

## SiteURL

*string*

The name of a host that will be used for two purposes:
- It will override the server's site URL.
- It will populate a new entry in the /etc/hosts file of the app nodes, so that it points to the proxy private IP or, if there's no proxy, to the current app node.
This config is used for tests that require an existing database dump that contains permalinks. These permalinks point to a specific hostname. Without this setting, that hostname is not known by the nodes of a new deployment and the permalinks cannot be resolved.

## UsersFilePath

*string*

The path to a file containing a list of credentials for the controllers to use. If present, it is used to automatically upload it to the agents and override the agent's config's own [`UsersFilePath`](config.md/#UsersFilePath).

### EnableAgentProfiling

*bool*

Enable continuous profiling of all the agent instances.
