Action name which is mapped to SimpleController's actions. Available actions can be found [here](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-load-test-ng/blob/master/loadtest/control/simplecontroller/controller.go#L137).

#### WaitAfterMs

*int*

Wait time in milliseconds after the action is performed.

#### RunPeriod

The value of how often the action will be performed. The higher the value the lesser possibility to run the action.
