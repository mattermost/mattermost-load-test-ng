# Release Process

This document outlines the release process of the load-test tool. It is codified in [a Playbook](https://community.mattermost.com/playbooks/playbooks/95pa6a8fcp8p8xsn4frqejcide) that the team follows monthly in the Community server. If you don't have access to the playbook, please ping `@xyzteam` in the [Developers: Server channel](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/developers-server).

## Requirements

This release process follows [the release process of the self-hosted version of Mattermost](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/research-and-development/product/release-process/feature-release).

The requirements for this release process are the following:
- The monthly performance comparisons, where we compare the Mattermost version about to be released with the latest stable one, are based on the RC-1 version of the new release.
- We need a stable tested version of the load-test tool to run the performance comparisons.
- The final release build of Mattermost is cut at around T-10[^1].

[^1]: Mattermost release process specifies all the release events (feature complete, code freeze, release approval...) by using the T-n notation, where n is the number of business days before the release day. The specific dates for each event are made concrete at the beginning of each process release, and can be found in [the Mattermost Release Dates calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=mattermost.com_uu1k3ma6uvrjp6t7541cnte11c%40group.calendar.google.com).

As such, we base the timeline of our own release process on the following goal:

> We aim to have a new release ready on T-11.

There may be times when there are no changes in the load-test tool, and that's fine. In those cases, we can skip the release altogether.

## Process

The goal of this release process is to have a well-tested version where bugs can be surfaced before we use it for the monthly performance comparisons and other analysis. Then, the main part of it will be the testing process, and we will skip any release whose tests did not pass before the testing period ends.

- T-24 (owned by Dev): Judge whether we need a new release: are there significant changes since last version? If there are, cut the release branch and continue with next steps. If there are not, skip the release.
- From T-23 to T-12 (owned by QA, assisted by Dev): Testing period.
    - Run a performance comparison test with bounded and unbounded tests, Postgres and MySQL, using the latest stable release of Mattermost as both the base and new builds. This test will pass if and only if:
        - All four tests finish successfully.
        - There is no significant difference between the base and new builds (they're the same build, and thus should ideally output the same exact results).
    - If bugs are found in the load-test tool:
        - Fix them in master.
        - Cherry-pick them to the release branch.
        - Run the test again.
- T-12 end of day (owned by Dev): judge whether the tests successfully passed and decide if the release will happen the next day.
- T-11 (owned by Dev): If the tests passed, release a new version. If not, skip the release for this month.
- From T-10 (owned by Dev): Run the actual performance comparison with the latest stable version of the load-test tool.

### Owners

There are two roles specified in this process:

- Dev: the main owner of the whole process, in charge of cutting the release branch, assisting during the testing period, judging whether the release is ready and releasing the new version.
- QA: the main owner of the testing period, in charge of running the tests and filing the bugs.

The current people in charge of these roles are:
- Dev: @agarciamontoro
- QA: @DHaussermann

In the case that the primary Dev and QA are not available, we define Dev and QA backups:
- Dev backups: @streamer45, @agnivade, @isacikgoz
- QA backups: @agarciamontoro, @streamer45, @agnivade, @isacikgoz

### Output

The output of the release process is twofold:
- A commit tagged with the version number.
- A Github release, consisting of a bundle that contains:
    - The main asset: a tarball named `mattermost-load-test-ng-vx.y.z-linux-amd64.tar.gz`, that contains:
        - Binaries: `ltagent` and `ltapi`.
        - Sample configuration files.
        - License file.
    - Other assets bundled by Github itself:
        - Checksums file
        - A copy of the source code in both `zip` and `tar.gz` formats.


An example of this output for version v1.9.1 is:
- Commit: https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-load-test-ng/commit/b50140c25d495c4b12fa07d421ad584271b624ed
- Github release: https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-load-test-ng/releases/tag/v1.9.1
    - Main asset: https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-load-test-ng/releases/download/v1.9.1/mattermost-load-test-ng-v1.9.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz

## Release

This section outlines the technicalities of the release itself, once the new version is tested and approved. These steps will create both the tagged commit and the Github release.

We use a combination of `Makefile` and [Goreleser](https://goreleaser.com/) to automate this process, which consists of two steps:
1. Prepare the release and get the automatically created PR merged.
2. Do the actual release.

### Prepare the release

There are certain changes that we need to do for every release (for now, simply updating the default load-test URL in the config sample). You can automatically apply those changes with the following command:

```sh
make prepare-release NEXT_VER=v1.1.1
```

Follow the instructions in the output to create the PR. Once it's merged, continue with the next step.

### Actual release

With the PR already merged, you can now finish the process with the following command:

```sh
make release NEXT_VER=v1.1.1
```

`goreleaser` needs to use a Github token to create the release for you. You can define it inline with the `GITHUB_TOKEN` variable or write it to the default `~/.config/goreleaser/github_token` file. Read [`goreleaser` docs](https://goreleaser.com/scm/github/) for more info.
